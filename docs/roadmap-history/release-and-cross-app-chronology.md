# Release and Cross-App Chronology

Status: **HISTORICAL ROADMAP EVIDENCE — NOT CURRENT PLANNING AUTHORITY**

This file preserves complete dated roadmap sections extracted from
`docs/roadmap.md` during the bounded first Roadmap Slimming Migration. The
transcribed blocks below retain their original wording, order, and status
language. Their statements of `current`, `next`, `open`, or release priority
describe their original snapshots only. Consult the [current roadmap](../roadmap.md)
and its status index for current planning. This broad chronology groups public
release and cross-application integration checkpoints; it is not an issue- or
checkpoint-per-file archive. Original source order is retained rather than
re-sorting blocks by date.

## Transcribed roadmap blocks

<!-- The following blocks are verbatim extractions from roadmap.md at the
     migration baseline, commit a0d5524fab7363c03364118cfa6e8665c8bf8844. -->

## Initial Public Release critical path

The first public release should establish a complete user journey:

`learn E2R -> discover samples in the Hub -> open a Dataset in NarrativeLine
or LiaisonScape -> edit safely -> export -> return to documentation`.

The Hub / Portal public entry point is complete for the accepted Hub Public
Entry Point Information Architecture (Milestone 1) and the manually accepted
Static E2R Landing Page Implementation (Milestone 2). The current evidence
covers E2R introduction, application purposes, capability and maturity status,
sample cards, documentation, user guides, and application entry points.
Direct Hub Handoff and Initial Public Release remain incomplete.

The critical path is:

1. **NarrativeLine modernization** — COMPLETE for the accepted bounded
   Dataset Replacement Safety and Dataset Handoff v0 scope after auditing NarrativeLine's
   existing temporal editing and pending-work model. The accepted work includes
   safe Open, New, and Sample
   replacement, loss-risk tracking, pending-work protection, browser-native
   exit warning, explicit handoff failure, no silent fallback, startup-only
   handoff, and the distinction between acquisition URL and Dataset identity.
   Acceptance evidence is recorded in the NarrativeLine NL-D4, NL-D5A, NL-D5B,
   NL-H1A, NL-H1B, and Formal Completion documents.
2. **NarrativeLine navigation ownership** — audit Browser Back/Forward,
   `history.state`, `popstate`, Home/editor navigation, fragment ownership,
   runtime fragment changes, and the separation of screen navigation from
   Dataset replacement. Foreign history state must not be misinterpreted.
3. **Hub / Portal public entry point** — provide E2R introduction, application
   purposes, capability and maturity status, sample gallery, documentation,
   user guides, and application entry points.
4. **Public interoperability evidence** — continue Validator, canonical and
   sample Dataset, public handoff fixture, cross-application fixture, and
   unknown-Extension preservation checks.
5. **Release documentation synchronization** — align each repository's README,
   user guide, roadmap, implementation status, deployment state, and sample
   links. Use `implemented`, `manually accepted`, `research / experimental`,
   and `deferred / on hold` consistently.

Direct Hub handoff can be evaluated as a later workstream. NarrativeLine Handoff
v0 completion does not claim Hub direct handoff, public release completion,
private/authenticated Handoff support, or any future multi-Dataset workflow, and
this section does not promote Direct Hub handoff to a release blocker.

## Current public-release execution priority (2026-08-22)

The current bounded execution order is:

1. Cross-App Locale Recipient-Preference closure / production readiness;
2. NarrativeLine locale consumer implementation (blocked until Priority 1
   closure is accepted);
3. LiaisonScape locale consumer implementation;
4. Hub startup locale producer completion;
5. Hub Direct Handoff and localized Sample Gallery local acceptance;
6. Hub residual quality audit and Formal Completion;
7. E2R common favicon design and application to Hub, NarrativeLine, and
   LiaisonScape (Validator remains excluded unless deployment evidence changes);
8. LiaisonScape selectable SVG icons;
9. NarrativeLine display-order reordering;
10. push and deployment readiness;
11. Public Handoff/interoperability evidence; and
12. final pre-public-release audit.

This current priority supersedes the earlier recommendation to make Public
Interoperability Evidence / Sample Workflow the immediate next workstream. That
workstream remains planned and is intentionally deferred until the public-facing
product state is closer to final. The ordering does not make Dataset language
metadata, localized-counterpart architecture, Dictionary, or Semantic research
an Initial Public Release blocker.

## Cross-App Shell follow-up record (2026-08-23)

Cross-App Shell Alignment identified two bounded NarrativeLine follow-ups. The
Timeline item is now closed by the accepted runtime checkpoint below. The
remaining Credits item is already closed by the locale-consumer checkpoint.
These records do not reopen the accepted F2-NL1 locale Header
placement, F2-NL1b Footer geometry, or F2-NL1c extreme-narrow Header geometry:

1. **NarrativeLine Timeline shell navigation** — **CLOSED / ACCEPTED** at
   runtime commit `4868111b02aa850bb0c652ab3b3470dcd92595a0`. The explicit
   localized `Home` action is in the Timeline Header beside the NarrativeLine
   brand and locale control; the lower sticky area retains Add Event only.
   Existing contextual `Back` behavior for nested surfaces remains separate.
2. **NarrativeLine Credits dismissal** — **CLOSED / ACCEPTED** through the
   NarrativeLine locale-consumer checkpoint: explicit Close, Escape, and
   backdrop click, with focus and state behavior preserved.

These are application-shell checkpoints, not changes to `#locale`, recipient
preference semantics, Dataset Handoff, Dataset language, Dataset state, or graph
state. LiaisonScape's Credits backdrop dismissal is already implemented and is
not part of this record. The work should be evaluated before Cross-App Shell
Alignment is marked formally complete and before the final pre-public-release
audit; it is not by itself a claim that public release is blocked.

The Timeline Header change must include bounded browser and human-acceptance
checks for EN/JA, desktop, 601px/600px, representative narrow widths, roughly
270px and 240px boundaries, locale-button wrapping, brand/Home/locale overlap,
keyboard Tab order, and preservation of nested-surface Back semantics. No
workspace-wide minimum width is implied by the existing narrow-viewport
acceptance boundary.

## Immediate sequence

The ledger above is the current short execution sequence. Existing locale,
shell, and application checkpoints below remain historical evidence and
independently scoped follow-ups; they are not silently promoted by this ledger.

The ordering above does not select the next product feature. A later handoff or
explicit planning decision may choose one bounded follow-up without reopening
unrelated workstreams.

At every step, prefer the smallest change that increases executable evidence
and keeps Core and Extension responsibilities distinct.

## Cross-App Locale consumer readiness checkpoint (2026-08-23)

The latest read-only NarrativeLine Locale Consumer Readiness Audit records the
current production-migration status as **NOT READY**. The existing
recipient-preference implementation is a bounded experimental checkpoint, not
production Cross-App Locale consumer parity. NarrativeLine's runtime worktree
is clean and the relevant experiment implementation is recorded at commit
`bfe88f6`.

Priority 1 is therefore **Cross-App Locale Recipient-Preference closure /
production readiness**. The following bounded closure items must be accepted
before production locale consumer migration begins:

1. Confirm the browser fallback contract and its NarrativeLine implementation
   direction while preserving the requested / persisted / browser / default
   distinction.
2. Complete manual startup evidence for locale-only, invalid, duplicate,
   malformed, and unsupported locale requests; effective-locale Handoff
   errors; temporary-choice reload; and repeated Conflict Dialog behavior.
3. Record the Experiment 2C applicability audit: current startup Locale
   Conflict cannot coexist with pre-existing modified or pending work, so no
   combined implementation case is active until a future entry permits that
   coexistence; Dataset Replacement Safety remains independently accepted.
4. Add and accept selector URL synchronization: immediate UI update,
   explicit persistence, `locale`-only `replaceState`, no new history entry,
   and preservation of `datasetUrl` and unknown fragment parameters.
5. Close the locale URL lifecycle evidence for Back / Forward, startup-only
   semantics, ignored runtime hash mutation, and Dataset Handoff fragment
   preservation.
6. Close NarrativeLine Timeline Header locale-control acceptance for EN and
   JA at desktop, narrow, and touch conditions.

The existing NarrativeLine experiment acceptance documents remain valid within
their bounded scopes. Experiment 1 does not close the manual/lifecycle items
above, and Experiment 2B does not accept startup Handoff with pre-existing
dirty work. These exclusions must not be treated as production-readiness
evidence.

The production implementation sequence remains deferred until this checkpoint
is accepted. Once ready, the smallest sequence is: locale fragment parser and
updater; requested / persisted / browser / effective state model; Conflict
Dialog and startup orchestration; Handoff ordering and StrictMode regression;
AppFrame selector persistence and fragment synchronization; Dataset,
selection, draft, and Replacement Safety regression; then browser acceptance.

This checkpoint does not reopen accepted F2-NL1/NL1b/NL1c or F2-LS1. Existing
Cross-App shell follow-ups, Dataset acquisition hierarchy, Header action parity,
and Dataset Replacement styling remain separate follow-up lanes. The accepted
LiaisonScape F2-LS1 checkpoint remains closed; its brand hit-area,
Credits-focus, and stable vertical shell fixes are not locale-readiness gaps.

No runtime, design-authority, or `ai-knowledge` files are changed by this
roadmap synchronization. The existing untracked files
`research/exploratory/anonymous-dataset-sharing.md` and
`sessions/E2R-Session-0048.md` remain preserved and outside this checkpoint.
## Roadmap reconstruction checkpoint — completed Cross-App deletion and capability Handoff progression

Historical source: complete original H3 entries from `docs/roadmap.md` at
`e17e778` (`docs: slim roadmap release and cross-app tranche`). Their source
order, dates, status wording, and evidence text are retained. Relative Markdown
hrefs are adjusted only to resolve from this chronology file; original
path-only prose remains unchanged. Status terms inside these entries describe
their dated checkpoint snapshots, not current planning authority. Current
Cross-App status remains in [the roadmap](../roadmap.md#roadmap-reconstruction-checkpoint-current-canonical-summary).
### LS-CROSS-APP-RELATION-DELETION4-PRESENTATION-FOLLOWUP

**RECORDED / IMPLEMENTATION NOT STARTED** — 2026-08-28.

The Formal Real Edge acceptance for LiaisonScape Entity deletion resolution is
accepted for behavior and focus. A separate manual visual review recorded the
following presentation and copy follow-ups. They are presentation polish, not
acceptance blockers, and this record does not reopen the accepted deletion
semantics or focus contract.

1. **Human-facing blocker copy:** the Japanese `ブロッカー` wording is useful
   as internal workflow terminology but is a candidate for clearer user-facing
   copy describing the connected Relations that must be removed before the
   Entity can be deleted. The candidate copy must be aligned in English and
   Japanese before implementation; no runtime copy change is made here.
2. **Zero-blocker action spacing:** the `Keep Entity` and `Delete Entity`
   footer actions appear visually close in the resolved state. Review spacing
   and grouping using the existing action-layout conventions across desktop,
   narrow, EN, JA, and keyboard focus-visible states; do not prescribe a fixed
   margin value in this record.
3. **Keep Entity duplication:** the safe `Keep Entity` action is currently
   available in both the dialog header and footer. Review whether the same
   semantic action should remain in both locations or be consolidated, while
   preserving the existing cancellation behavior and safe focus target.
4. **Safe/destructive placement convention:** audit the placement of safe and
   destructive actions across NarrativeLine Entity/Event Detail, deletion
   resolution and confirmation, LiaisonScape Entity/Relation Detail, existing
   confirmations, and the current Entity deletion resolution dialog. Compare
   safe action position, destructive action position, Danger Zone placement,
   footer grouping, gap, wrap order, narrow-width order, Tab order, and EN/JA
   label width. This is an evidence-gathering follow-up, not a universal
   Cross-App left/right rule.

The follow-up remains separate from bidirectional Cross-App acceptance and
overall capability closure. Any implementation should be a bounded
presentation/copy checkpoint with its own desktop/narrow, EN/JA, and keyboard
acceptance evidence. It must not change Entity/Relation deletion semantics,
Relation visibility or identity, Dataset ownership, routing, viewport or
pointer behavior, Handoff, Core/Extension/schema behavior, or the accepted
focus-management fix.

### LS-CROSS-APP-RELATION-DELETION5-ACTION-HIERARCHY-AUDIT

**AUDIT COMPLETE / DESIGN DIRECTION RECORDED / IMPLEMENTATION NOT STARTED** —
2026-08-28.

The bounded action-hierarchy audit is recorded in
[Cross-App Destructive Action Hierarchy Audit](../cross-app-destructive-action-hierarchy-audit.md).
NarrativeLine and LiaisonScape evidence does not establish a universal
safe-left / destructive-right rule. The reusable principle is one clearly
identified safe choice before the destructive choice in DOM and keyboard order,
with visual separation selected according to the host surface. For the current
LiaisonScape Entity deletion resolution dialog, the recommended bounded
direction is one footer `Keep Entity` followed by zero-blocker-only `Delete
Entity`, with the duplicate header `Keep Entity` removed. Narrow stacking,
final EN/JA copy, and exact spacing remain implementation work.

This is a design/source audit only. Runtime, CSS, i18n, tests, deletion
semantics, and the accepted focus fix are unchanged. Bidirectional Cross-App
acceptance and overall capability closure remain pending.

### LS-CROSS-APP-RELATION-DELETION6-PRESENTATION-IMPLEMENTATION

**AUTOMATED IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / FORMAL BOUNDED REAL EDGE PRESENTATION
ACCEPTANCE PENDING** — 2026-08-28.

The bounded LiaisonScape presentation implementation is complete at commit
`34d8164` (`fix: refine Entity deletion resolution presentation`) and is
recorded in [LiaisonScape Relation Deletion Resolution Presentation
Implementation](../liaisonscape-relation-deletion-resolution-presentation-implementation.md).
The duplicate header `Keep Entity` was removed; the footer now keeps one safe
action before zero-blocker-only `Delete Entity`, with a bounded desktop gap and
safe-before-danger full-width narrow stacking. Human-facing EN/JA copy now
describes connected Relations without exposing `blocker` terminology.

Automated tests, lint, build, and diff checks passed. This checkpoint does not
claim formal browser visual acceptance, bidirectional Cross-App acceptance, or
capability closure. The next checkpoint is bounded Real Edge presentation
acceptance; deletion semantics and the accepted focus fix remain unchanged.

### LS-CROSS-APP-RELATION-DELETION7-PRESENTATION-REAL-EDGE-ACCEPTANCE

**FORMALLY ACCEPTED / COMPLETE** — 2026-08-28.

The bounded LiaisonScape presentation refinement passed dedicated Microsoft
Edge visual/interaction acceptance at runtime commit `34d8164`. Evidence is
recorded in [LiaisonScape Relation Deletion Resolution Presentation
Acceptance](../liaisonscape-relation-deletion-resolution-presentation-acceptance.md).
P1/P2 copy, P3 duplicate-action removal, P4/P5 zero-blocker EN/JA layout, P6
desktop spacing, P7 narrow safe-before-danger stacking, and P10 focus
regression all passed. P8/P9/P11/P12 passed as bounded regression evidence.

The acceptance confirms one footer `Keep Entity`, zero-blocker-only `Delete
Entity`, visible desktop separation, full-width narrow stacking, connected
Relation wording, and preserved deletion/focus semantics. Bidirectional
Cross-App acceptance and overall capability closure remain pending.

### XAPP-REL-DELETE3 bidirectional acceptance (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-REL-DELETE3-BIDIRECTIONAL-ACCEPTANCE` was executed as an acceptance-only
checkpoint and is recorded in
[Cross-App Relation Deletion Bidirectional Acceptance](../cross-app-relation-deletion-bidirectional-acceptance.md).
The result is **FORMAL BIDIRECTIONAL ACCEPTANCE: FAIL**. NarrativeLine at
`3b2078f` and LiaisonScape at `34d8164` passed the automated gates and the
bounded Relation, self, parallel, hidden/Event, ambiguity, cancellation, and
extension-preservation checks. LiaisonScape final Entity deletion passed, but
NarrativeLine retained `entity-nl-final` after its two incident Relations were
resolved and final Entity deletion was confirmed. No runtime source was
changed; no runtime commit was created.

The final Cross-App acceptance remains pending, and capability closure remains
deferred. X11 must be resolved and the full bidirectional matrix, including
locale parity, must be re-accepted before item 6 can advance. No targeted
Handoff closure is claimed.

### XAPP-REL-DELETE4 — NarrativeLine final Entity deletion fix (2026-08-28)

**IMPLEMENTED / AUTOMATED GREEN / EXPLORATORY REAL EDGE PASS** at NarrativeLine
commit `7a695b3` (`fix: complete final Entity deletion`). The X11 stale-state
overwrite risk was corrected with a functional Dataset updater, and a focused
real-App regression test now covers explicit resolution of both incident
Relations, cancellation and reopening of final Entity confirmation, and
confirmed target deletion with preservation of unrelated Entity/Event data.
The full 187-test suite, lint, build, and diff checks passed; a fresh Edge
smoke also passed the export assertions.

The prior `XAPP-REL-DELETE3-BIDIRECTIONAL-ACCEPTANCE` FAIL record is preserved.
Formal bidirectional acceptance must be rerun in both directions, including
the full X1-X14 matrix and locale parity; capability closure remains deferred.
The separately recorded NarrativeLine endpoint-separator mojibake and
LiaisonScape generic-dialog button-spacing findings remain presentation
follow-ups and were not fixed in this checkpoint. LiaisonScape runtime source
and the pre-existing dirty CDP diagnostic playbook were unchanged.

### XAPP-REL-DELETE5 bidirectional reacceptance (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-REL-DELETE5-BIDIRECTIONAL-REACCEPTANCE` is **FORMALLY ACCEPTED / COMPLETE**
at NarrativeLine `7a695b3` and LiaisonScape `34d8164`. The full X1-X14
Cross-App matrix passed in both directions, including the repaired
NarrativeLine final Entity deletion, LiaisonScape final Entity deletion,
self/parallel/hidden Relations, duplicate identity, Cancel safety, unknown
Extension preservation, Dataset export/open transfer, and EN/JA semantic
parity. NarrativeLine (187), LiaisonScape (216), CDP helper (4), and e2r-spec
validation gates were green; dedicated Edge evidence confirmed native dialog
state `closed`.

The original `XAPP-REL-DELETE3-BIDIRECTIONAL-ACCEPTANCE` FAIL record remains
historical and unchanged. Bidirectional acceptance is now closed for this
bounded workstream, but capability closure, targeted Handoff discovery, and
the deferred NarrativeLine endpoint-separator mojibake and cross-app generic
confirmation button-spacing findings remain separate follow-ups. No runtime
source or ai-knowledge change was made in this acceptance-only checkpoint.

### XAPP-REL-DELETE6 capability closure (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-REL-DELETE6-CAPABILITY-CLOSURE` is **FORMALLY ACCEPTED / CROSS-APP
IMPLEMENTATION ALIGNED / COMPLETE**. The closure is recorded in [Cross-App
Relation Deletion Capability Closure](../cross-app-relation-deletion-capability-closure.md).
The canonical status is now:

- Cross-App Relation deletion design: **ACCEPTED**;
- NarrativeLine implementation: **ACCEPTED / COMPLETE**;
- LiaisonScape implementation: **ACCEPTED / COMPLETE**;
- bidirectional Dataset interoperability: **FORMALLY ACCEPTED / COMPLETE**;
- bounded Cross-App Relation deletion capability: **COMPLETE / CLOSED**.

The closure covers the accepted semantic contract, explicit Relation deletion,
no silent cascade, hidden and Event-related Relation handling, self and
parallel Relation identity, final explicit Entity deletion, unrelated Dataset
preservation, and the successful X1-X14 matrix in both directions. The prior
XAPP-REL-DELETE3 FAIL record remains historical and unchanged; its X11 defect
was corrected by NarrativeLine commit `7a695b3` and passed in the XAPP-REL-DELETE5
reacceptance.

Targeted capability-based Handoff, capability discovery/manifest, target-app
discovery, Handoff URL syntax, provenance, generalized Relation editing, and
bulk deletion remain separate future work. The deferred NarrativeLine endpoint
separator mojibake and generic Cross-App confirmation button-spacing findings
also remain separate presentation follow-ups. No Core, Extension, schema,
runtime, or ai-knowledge change was made by this documentation-only closure.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF1 discovery audit (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF1-DISCOVERY-AUDIT` is **AUDIT COMPLETE / DESIGN
DIRECTION RECORDED / IMPLEMENTATION NOT AUTHORIZED**. The audit is recorded in
[Cross-App Capability Handoff Discovery Audit](../cross-app-capability-handoff-discovery-audit.md).

The source audit confirms that NarrativeLine and LiaisonScape implement the
accepted Dataset Handoff v0 `datasetUrl` startup flow, while Hub currently
generates explicit sample links to those applications. None of the three
currently publishes or consumes a target Object plus required-capability
declaration for runtime routing. Existing Cross-App Relation deletion remains
**FORMALLY ACCEPTED / CROSS-APP IMPLEMENTATION ALIGNED / COMPLETE** and is not
reopened by this audit.

The recorded first bounded direction is a reviewed static table of first-party
known applications with operation-level capabilities such as `inspect Relation`
and `delete Relation`, canonical full target Object IDs, explicit user action,
recipient-side verification, no network dependency, no automatic third-party
discovery, and a safe no-recipient fallback. Hub may later publish or explain
the table but is not a required registry authority.

The next bounded step is target contract design covering Dataset state,
canonical target identity, required capability, recipient selection,
URL/history ownership, stale target and stale metadata behavior, trust,
privacy, and user confirmation. No manifest schema, URL syntax, runtime
discovery, automatic redirect, registry, Core, Extension, schema, or
application-source change is authorized by this audit.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF2 target contract design (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF2-TARGET-CONTRACT-DESIGN` is **DESIGN ACCEPTED / URL
CONTRACT NOT YET DESIGNED / IMPLEMENTATION NOT AUTHORIZED**. The accepted
transport-independent contract is recorded in [Cross-App Capability Handoff
Target Contract](../cross-app-capability-handoff-target-contract.md).

The minimum semantic tuple is a transferable Dataset context, the canonical
full target Object ID, and one primary required capability. `targetObjectType`
is an optional consistency hint and never replaces the canonical ID. The first
capability identifiers are application-neutral `relation.inspect` and
`relation.delete`; deletion requires inspection as a safety prerequisite and
never means immediate mutation. Source application identity is optional
diagnostic context, recipient identity is resolved separately, locale is
orthogonal, and a separate Target Contract version must not be confused with
Core, Extension, Dataset, or application version.

Missing target, type mismatch, stale capability metadata, and unsupported
capability all fail non-destructively. Inspect-only support is not a silent
downgrade from delete. Existing Dataset Handoff v0 `datasetUrl` semantics and
Hub sample links remain unchanged. The Cross-App Relation deletion capability
remains **FORMALLY ACCEPTED / CROSS-APP IMPLEMENTATION ALIGNED / COMPLETE**.

The next bounded step is recorded below as URL/transport contract design. No
Core, Extension, schema, application source, capability manifest, runtime
discovery, automatic redirect, or registry change is authorized by this
checkpoint.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF3 URL/transport contract design (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF3-URL-TRANSPORT-CONTRACT-DESIGN` is **DESIGN ACCEPTED /
TRANSPORT CONTRACT DEFINED / IMPLEMENTATION NOT AUTHORIZED**. The accepted
transport is recorded in [Cross-App Capability Handoff URL/Transport
Contract](../cross-app-capability-handoff-url-transport-contract.md).

The first direction extends Dataset Handoff v0's flat URL fragment. It carries
the existing retrievable absolute HTTPS `datasetUrl`, the canonical full
`targetObjectId`, optional exact-case `targetObjectType`,
`requiredCapability`, and `targetContractVersion=1`. Targeted requests are
startup-only, validate duplicates and malformed values, preserve the existing
locale contract, and never turn Handoff into an automatic deletion command.
`relation.delete` still requires safe inspection/presentation and explicit user
action; unknown, stale, mismatched, or unsupported input fails
non-destructively.

The first transport does not carry inline or current-edited Dataset state,
pending drafts, recipient identity, source ownership, or capability
negotiation. Existing v0 links remain unchanged, and an old recipient may
open the Dataset but cannot claim that targeted intent was fulfilled. Cross-App
Relation deletion remains **FORMALLY ACCEPTED / CROSS-APP IMPLEMENTATION
ALIGNED / COMPLETE**. Endpoint-separator and dialog-spacing findings remain
deferred.

The next bounded step is the current Dataset transfer design below, followed by
an implementation-readiness audit. Runtime implementation requires explicit
authorization from a later checkpoint.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF4 current Dataset transfer design (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF4-CURRENT-DATASET-TRANSFER-DESIGN` is **DESIGN
ACCEPTED / FIRST CURRENT-DATASET TRANSFER BOUNDARY DEFINED / IMPLEMENTATION
NOT AUTHORIZED**. The design is recorded in [Cross-App Capability Handoff
Current Dataset Transfer Design](../cross-app-capability-handoff-current-dataset-transfer-design.md).

The accepted first direction has two lanes. A clean Dataset with a known
retrievable URL may use the existing targeted URL Handoff. A modified committed
Dataset or a local Dataset without a source URL uses explicit Export followed by
explicit Open in the recipient; target metadata is not embedded in Core or an
Extension, so the user re-selects the target. Pending work blocks current-state
Handoff until explicitly committed or discarded. Modified plus pending work
requires both boundaries to be resolved.

The transfer is a committed snapshot at export time, using the existing
validated export/serialization path and preserving unknown valid fields and
Extensions. It does not introduce revision fields, fingerprints, hosted
uploads, transfer tokens, live synchronization, or a new URL parameter. No
silent public sharing, stale URL fallback, draft transfer, automatic target
action, or destructive mutation is authorized. Discovery, Target Contract,
URL/Transport Contract, and Cross-App Relation deletion remain accepted; the
endpoint-separator and dialog-spacing findings remain deferred.

The next bounded step is implementation-readiness review for this two-lane
boundary: exact Export/Open ownership, round-trip preservation, dirty/pending
transitions, failure states, and manual target re-selection. Runtime work
requires explicit authorization from that checkpoint.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF5 implementation readiness (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF5-IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS` is **READINESS AUDIT
COMPLETE / READY FOR A BOUNDED IMPLEMENTATION CHECKPOINT / IMPLEMENTATION NOT
AUTHORIZED**. The audit is recorded in [Cross-App Capability Handoff
Implementation Readiness](../cross-app-capability-handoff-implementation-readiness.md).

The audit confirms that the accepted contracts can be implemented with
responsibility-based application modularization. e2r-spec owns contract
semantics; each recipient owns its supported capability and safe landing
surface; the sender owns a small reviewed first-party catalog and current
Dataset availability gate; and Hub remains an optional human-facing
publication surface. No shared runtime package is introduced at this stage.

The first bounded implementation target is LiaisonScape as the recipient:
targeted parsing, exact Relation resolution, and safe `relation.inspect`
landing on the existing Relation Detail surface. The first meaningful sender
direction is then NarrativeLine's existing Entity deletion-resolution Relation
row to LiaisonScape. It is inspect-only, does not open deletion confirmation,
and does not authorize mutation. The current Dataset transfer two-lane safety
boundary remains in force: clean known HTTPS source URLs may use targeted
Handoff; modified/local or pending state uses explicit Export then Open.

The next sequence is recipient implementation and acceptance, followed by
targeted delete-intent compatibility, NarrativeLine source URL tracking and
availability gating, the contextual sender trigger, and cross-app Real Edge
acceptance. No runtime, Core, Extension, schema, Validator, Hub routing, or
ai-knowledge change is authorized by this readiness audit. Endpoint-separator
and dialog-spacing findings remain deferred, and Cross-App Relation deletion
remains closed.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF6 LiaisonScape recipient inspect (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF6-LS-RECIPIENT-INSPECT1` is **IMPLEMENTED / AUTOMATED
GREEN / BOUNDED BROWSER SMOKE PASS** at LiaisonScape commit `0f7fe1c`. The
implementation record is [LiaisonScape Capability Handoff Relation Inspect
Implementation](../liaisonscape-capability-handoff-relation-inspect-implementation.md).

LiaisonScape now parses the accepted targeted flat fragment while preserving
ordinary Dataset Handoff v0 behavior, reuses the existing HTTPS Dataset
acquisition and validation path, resolves the exact canonical Relation ID,
checks the optional exact `Relation` type hint, and lands on the existing
Relation Detail surface for `relation.inspect`. Missing targets, type
mismatches, malformed targeted metadata, and unsupported capabilities fail
non-destructively. `relation.delete` is not implemented here; it cannot open
Delete Confirmation or mutate the Dataset.

The runtime gate passed with 223 tests, lint, build, and diff checks. A bounded
Edge/CDP smoke against the public Lighthouse Dataset opened
`clara-thomas-supervises` in Relation Detail with no confirmation dialog; the
helper's native-dialog state was verified `closed` after its explicit probe.
The targeted and locale fragment remained inspectable. No NarrativeLine,
Hub, capability table, Core, Extension, schema, or Validator change was made.
The next bounded step is the separate `relation.delete` intent compatibility
checkpoint. Cross-App Relation deletion remains closed; endpoint-separator and
dialog-spacing findings remain deferred.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF7 LiaisonScape recipient Relation delete intent (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF7-LS-RECIPIENT-DELETE-INTENT1` is **IMPLEMENTED /
AUTOMATED GREEN / BOUNDED BROWSER SMOKE PASS** at LiaisonScape commit
`95a8c56`. The implementation record is [LiaisonScape Capability Handoff
Relation Delete Intent Implementation](../liaisonscape-capability-handoff-relation-delete-intent-implementation.md).

LiaisonScape now treats accepted `relation.delete` as a non-destructive intent:
it reuses Dataset Handoff v0 acquisition, resolves the exact canonical Relation,
checks the optional `Relation` type hint and the bounded recipient capability,
and lands on the existing Relation Detail surface. The existing explicit Delete
action remains available, but Handoff receipt does not open Confirmation, focus
the destructive control, inject input, or mutate the Dataset. `relation.inspect`
and ordinary v0 behavior remain green; missing, mismatched, malformed, and
unknown targeted requests fail safely.

The LiaisonScape gate passed with 225 tests, lint, build, and diff checks. A
dedicated Edge/CDP smoke confirmed the exact `clara-thomas-supervises` landing,
closed native-dialog state, no initial destructive focus, explicit Delete then
Cancel safety, locale coexistence, reload, and Back/Forward behavior. The
closed Cross-App Relation deletion capability remains closed. NarrativeLine
sender implementation is the next bounded step; capability table publication,
Hub changes, Core/Extension/schema changes, endpoint-separator mojibake, and
dialog-spacing findings remain deferred.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF8-NL-SENDER1 (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF8-NL-SENDER1` is **BLOCKED / NO RUNTIME CHANGE**. The
requested NarrativeLine sender slice was stopped at the pre-implementation
gate and is recorded in [NarrativeLine Capability Handoff
Sender Implementation](../narrativeline-capability-handoff-sender-implementation.md).

At that checkpoint, the readiness document still stated **IMPLEMENTATION NOT
AUTHORIZED** and did not record whether targeted recipient navigation was
same-tab or new-tab/window. No sender button, URL builder, source URL state,
recipient config, or navigation handler was added. Modified/local/pending
Dataset safety boundaries and the explicit Export/Open fallback remain
unchanged. Generic capability-table publication, Hub changes, endpoint-
separator work, and dialog-spacing work remain deferred.

The next bounded step is to update the readiness authority with explicit
sender authorization and navigation behavior, then retry the sender
implementation.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF8A-SENDER-NAVIGATION-AUTHORIZATION (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF8A-SENDER-NAVIGATION-AUTHORIZATION` is **DESIGN
COMPLETE / BOUNDED NARRATIVELINE SENDER AUTHORIZED / NO RUNTIME CHANGE**. The
design record is [Cross-App Capability Handoff Sender Navigation
Authorization](../cross-app-capability-handoff-sender-navigation-authorization.md).

The two Handoff8 blockers are resolved. The next bounded NarrativeLine sender
implementation is authorized for the existing Entity deletion-resolution
Relation row and `relation.inspect` only. Navigation is **same-tab by default**
using a native anchor and a pure targeted URL builder; ordinary browser
modifier behavior may open another context. This avoids popup-blocker and
opener-security concerns without forcing focus or a new window. The sender
must use a reviewed, environment-aware LiaisonScape configuration, and the
existing clean/no-pending/known-HTTPS-source gate and explicit Export/Open
fallback remain mandatory.

The Handoff8 blocked attempt remains historical evidence. Discovery, Target
Contract, Transport Contract, Current Dataset Transfer, Relation deletion
closure, and both LiaisonScape recipient capabilities remain accepted or
implemented. Generic capability-table publication, Hub targeted Handoff,
endpoint-separator work, dialog-spacing work, and formal cross-app acceptance
remain deferred. The next checkpoint is the bounded NarrativeLine sender
implementation; this authorization does not begin it automatically.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF8B-NL-SENDER-IMPLEMENTATION1 (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF8B-NL-SENDER-IMPLEMENTATION1` is **IMPLEMENTED /
AUTOMATED GREEN / BOUNDED CROSS-APP SMOKE PARTIAL**. The implementation record
is [NarrativeLine Capability Handoff Sender Runtime Implementation](../narrativeline-capability-handoff-sender-runtime-implementation.md).

NarrativeLine now exposes the authorized Entity deletion-resolution Relation
row sender surface for `relation.inspect`. It uses a pure targeted URL builder,
the accepted flat-fragment fields, the canonical full Relation ID, an
environment-aware LiaisonScape configuration, and a native same-tab `<a
href>` with no imperative navigation. Clean/no-pending/known-HTTPS-source
eligibility gates targeted navigation. Modified, local, source-less, invalid,
and pending state retain the existing safe explicit Export/Open boundary; no
Dataset or deletion mutation was added.

NarrativeLine verification is green: 194 tests passed, lint passed, build
passed, and diff checking passed. A dedicated Edge smoke confirmed the sender
surface, exact URL fields, same-tab navigation to the public LiaisonScape
origin, same Dataset acquisition, and absence of browser/delete confirmation.
The current public deployment did not expose the targeted Relation Detail
after fragment loading, so exact public recipient landing remains unclaimed
and should be reconciled in a later compatibility/acceptance checkpoint.

The historical Handoff8 BLOCKED record and Handoff8A authorization remain
unchanged. Cross-App Relation deletion remains closed; discovery, target and
transport contracts, current-Dataset transfer design, readiness, and both
LiaisonScape recipient implementations remain accepted or implemented. No
generic capability table, Hub targeted Handoff, Core/Extension/schema change,
endpoint-separator correction, dialog-spacing correction, or ai-knowledge
change was made.

The next bounded step is a fresh recipient deployment/real-edge compatibility
check for exact Relation Detail landing. Formal Cross-App Capability Handoff
acceptance, generic discovery, modified-Dataset automatic transfer, and other
deferred work remain separate.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF9-NL-LS-REAL-EDGE-ACCEPTANCE1 (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF9-NL-LS-REAL-EDGE-ACCEPTANCE1` is **FORMALLY ACCEPTED /
CURRENT SOURCE REVISIONS**. The acceptance record is [Cross-App Capability
Handoff NL-LS Real Edge Acceptance](../cross-app-capability-handoff-nl-ls-real-edge-acceptance.md).

Current-source revisions `158adec` (NarrativeLine), `95a8c56` (LiaisonScape),
and `39d6e08` (e2r-spec record) passed the fresh automated gates and bounded
Edge acceptance. Ordinary Dataset Handoff v0, the authorized NL native-anchor
sender, exact `relation.inspect` targeting, local LS Detail landing, hidden /
self / parallel / same-name identity checks, modified/local/pending safety,
locale coexistence, delete-intent safety, and Back/Forward behavior are
accepted at the current source revisions. Cross-App Relation deletion remains
closed.

The public deployment state is deliberately separate:
**PUBLIC DEPLOYMENT PARITY NOT YET ACCEPTED**. Prior public observation
established Dataset acquisition but not targeted Relation Detail landing, and
a fresh public probe encountered a CDP navigation timeout. This does not
authorize a runtime fix, deployment, or push; the next bounded step is public
revision/parity verification.

Handoff8 BLOCKED history and Handoff8A authorization remain unchanged.
Generic capability-table publication, dynamic discovery, Hub targeted Handoff,
modified-Dataset automatic transfer, endpoint-separator work, dialog-spacing
work, third-party interoperability, and ai-knowledge changes remain deferred.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF10-PUBLIC-DEPLOYMENT-PARITY-READINESS1 (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF10-PUBLIC-DEPLOYMENT-PARITY-READINESS1` is
**DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE / PUSH-DEPLOY NOT PERFORMED**. The readiness record is
[Cross-App Capability Handoff Public Deployment Parity Readiness](../cross-app-capability-handoff-public-deployment-parity-readiness.md).

Current-source acceptance remains green at NarrativeLine `158adec`,
LiaisonScape `95a8c56`, and the e2r-spec acceptance record `fb05042`.
Read-only remote checks confirmed that both required runtime commits remain
local-only on their remote `main` branches. Public NL and LS Pages URLs are
reachable, but the deployed bundles do not expose the current targeted
Handoff terms; public Relation Detail landing and deployed commit identity
therefore remain unaccepted. The formal classification is **A — REQUIRED
RUNTIME COMMITS NOT PUSHED**, with **C — DEPLOYED REVISION UNKNOWN** also
confirmed. No config mismatch or confirmed service-worker cache was found.

The documented decision is **READY TO AUTHORIZE PUSH/DEPLOY**, without taking
that action in this checkpoint. If authorized later, deploy LiaisonScape first,
verify its public targeted recipient and ordinary v0 paths, then deploy
NarrativeLine and verify the sender-to-public-recipient path. Presentation
issues, runtime fixes, generic discovery, Hub targeted Handoff, and
ai-knowledge changes remain deferred.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF11-LS-RECIPIENT-PUBLIC-DEPLOYMENT1 (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF11-LS-RECIPIENT-PUBLIC-DEPLOYMENT1` is **PUBLIC
LIAISONSCAPE RECIPIENT PARITY ACCEPTED**. The deployment record is
[LiaisonScape Capability Handoff Public Recipient Deployment](../liaisonscape-capability-handoff-public-recipient-deployment.md).

With explicit recipient-first authorization, LiaisonScape `95a8c56` was pushed
to `main` and deployed by the existing GitHub Pages workflow. Actions run
`33144996627` completed successfully for that exact head. Fresh dedicated Edge
verification passed ordinary Dataset Handoff v0, direct `relation.inspect`
targeting of `clara-thomas-supervises`, canonical self-Relation targeting,
non-destructive `relation.delete` intent, malformed/unsupported safe failure,
locale, reload, Back/Forward, and native-dialog closure. Public recipient
parity is accepted.

NarrativeLine public sender parity remains **NOT YET ACCEPTED** and full public
NL-to-LS E2E remains separate. Cross-App Relation deletion remains CLOSED.
Handoff8 historical BLOCKED evidence, generic capability-table/discovery,
Hub targeted Handoff, `Remove connection` presentation, endpoint separator,
dialog spacing, runtime fixes, and ai-knowledge changes remain deferred.

### XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF12-NL-SENDER-PUBLIC-DEPLOYMENT1 (2026-08-28)

`XAPP-CAPABILITY-HANDOFF12-NL-SENDER-PUBLIC-DEPLOYMENT1` is **PUBLIC
NARRATIVELINE SENDER AND PUBLIC NL-to-LS E2E ACCEPTED**. The deployment and
browser evidence is recorded in [Public NarrativeLine to LiaisonScape
Capability Handoff Acceptance](../cross-app-capability-handoff-public-nl-ls-acceptance.md).

With explicit authorization, NarrativeLine `158adec` was pushed to `main` and
deployed through the existing GitHub Pages workflow. Actions run `33146076558`
completed successfully for the exact head. Fresh public Edge verification
passed ordinary Dataset Handoff v0, the Entity deletion blocker sender,
`relation.inspect` URL generation, exact canonical `clara-lighthouse` landing,
hidden Event-related `lead-clara` landing, modified/pending safety, English and
Japanese locale transport, reload, Back/Forward, no Dataset mutation, and
native-dialog closure.

LiaisonScape `95a8c56` was unchanged and was not redeployed; its public
recipient parity remains accepted by Handoff11. Hub and ai-knowledge were
untouched. Cross-App Relation deletion remains CLOSED. Generic capability
discovery, `relation.delete` emission from NarrativeLine, presentation work,
and future capability expansion remain separate and deferred.

## Pre-release and LiaisonScape 0.2.0 release preparation chronology

The following five complete roadmap blocks were transferred from the bounded
pre-release / release-preparation sequence in `docs/roadmap.md` at source
commit `9cd1c3eebdfc7133458fd8d64a56fe6aa207b228`. Source wording, dates,
status language, block order, and provenance are preserved verbatim below.
All `current`, `next`, `blocked`, and `unauthorized` language describes its
dated snapshot, not current planning authority. See the current roadmap status
index and current Initial Layout coordination section for current state.

### PRE-RELEASE-VALIDATOR-AND-SEQUENCING-ROADMAP-SYNC1 (2026-08-29)

The remaining pre-release path is now synchronized around a mandatory
production Validator checkpoint. This is a roadmap record only; it does not
implement Validator behavior, node placement, sample refresh, application
version changes, or deployment.

Before Public Sample Dataset Refresh can be accepted, production Validator
integration and acceptance MUST cover the Presentation Extension Draft
`draft.github.sukoyaka-dopeness.liaisonscape-presentation`, version `0.1.0`:

* `arrowDisplay`: known `normal`, `reverse`, `undirected`, and
  `bidirectional` values.
* `lineStyle`: known `solid`, `dashed`, and `dotted` values.
* Unknown non-empty future tokens for both properties remain forward
  compatible: they must not make an otherwise valid payload fail solely for
  being unknown, and must remain preservable at the accepted boundary.
* Malformed payloads, including invalid types, empty tokens, and invalid
  structural shapes, must be rejected or reported at the appropriate
  Validator boundary without weakening Core validation.
* Core-only datasets remain unaffected, and unknown unrelated Extensions
  remain safely ignorable/preservable according to the Extension rules.
* Orphan Relation-ID Presentation records require an explicit semantic
  validation decision about diagnostic severity and boundary. That question
  remains open here; this sync does not decide orphan behavior.

Node automatic placement remains a separate Layout/placement responsibility.
Before the Validator checkpoint is complete, the project must determine
whether placement uses the existing Coordinate/Layout serialization or
introduces or changes a serialized contract. This sync assumes neither
outcome and chooses no placement algorithm or serialization. If placement
does introduce or change serialized data, its schema and Validator coverage
must be included before Public Sample Dataset Refresh; if it remains entirely
within existing valid serialization, the Presentation Validator scope stays
independent.

The remaining release sequence is:

1. Design, implement, and accept node automatic placement.
2. Resolve any resulting Coordinate/Layout serialization and schema
   implications. **CLOSED 2026-08-30:** the accepted automatic placement
   implementation introduces no new serialized contract, schema, or Validator
   work; see [Automatic Placement Serialization Impact](../liaisonscape-automatic-placement-serialization-impact-result.md).
3. Complete the separate Presentation lifecycle cleanup, including removal
   of a deleted Relation ID's Presentation record where appropriate.
4. Integrate and accept production Validator coverage for the release-
   relevant Extensions, including any newly serialized placement contract.
5. Refresh and accept the Public Sample Dataset only after the Validator
   checkpoint passes. Eventual acceptance also requires LiaisonScape
   open/render/edit smoke coverage, NarrativeLine open/round-trip coverage,
   Extension preservation, Hub/Handoff evidence, and license, credits, and
   sample-metadata checks.
6. Run the cross-application and release integration audit.
7. The LiaisonScape application version decision is now recorded as
   `0.2.0`. The current metadata remains `0.1.0`; the actual bump is deferred
   to bounded release preparation. See
   `docs/liaisonscape-application-version-decision.md`.
8. Run the final pre-public-release audit.
9. Obtain explicit authorization before any push or deployment.
10. Perform public deployment acceptance only after that authorization.

Lighthouse Restoration remains a later Public Sample Dataset workstream. It
does not authorize adding Relations or inferring Relations between mojibake
sample names. The completed Relation Arrow display work, Relation Line style
work, and LiaisonScape Credits locale-parity work remain closed and are not
reopened by this sequencing record. The existing application modularization
and repository boundaries remain in force.

### E2R-LIAISONSCAPE-0.2.0-RELEASE-PREPARATION1 (2026-08-30)

The bounded LiaisonScape application release preparation is complete locally.
Application metadata and Credits now identify `0.2.0`; the First Distribution
provenance date `2026-08-16` remains preserved, and the update metadata date is
`2026-08-30`. The README now reflects Validator `0.4.0` and the `0.2.0`
release-candidate state.

This preparation changes no Dataset, Core, Extension, schema, Handoff,
Validator, Coordinate, Presentation, DOM-package, or dependency version. The
application remains `private: true`. Tagging, GitHub Release, deployment, and
public acceptance remain separate later actions requiring explicit
authorization.

### E2R-PRE-RELEASE-ROADMAP-PLACEMENT-ORDER-LICENSE-RECORD1 (2026-08-30)

The current pre-public-release authority now supersedes the sequencing details
above while retaining them as historical records. LiaisonScape 0.2.0 remains
blocked on repository-owned `LICENSE`/`LICENSE.md` remediation; this checkpoint
does not add that file. The bounded audits and active sequence are recorded in
[Pre-Public-Release Placement, Display-Order, and License Sequencing](../pre-public-release-placement-order-license-sequencing.md).

The active order is license remediation, Initial Node Placement Objective Audit,
NarrativeLine Display-Order Reordering Audit, result-driven samples and release
evidence, Final Pre-Public-Release Audit, and—only if READY and explicitly
authorized—public sync, tag, GitHub Release, deployment, and public acceptance.
Neither audit authorizes Core, History, schema, or runtime implementation;
Research shelf inventory and the Hub concept page remain separate workstreams.

### E2R-LIAISONSCAPE-INITIAL-NODE-PLACEMENT-OBJECTIVE-AUDIT1 (2026-08-30)

The Initial Node Placement Objective Audit is recorded in [LiaisonScape Initial Node Placement Objective Audit](../liaisonscape-initial-node-placement-objective-audit.md).
The result is `SAMPLE REFRESH REQUIRED - INITIAL PLACEMENT ALGORITHM
ACCEPTABLE`: both Lighthouse Restoration samples contain stored coordinates
for all 10 Entities, so Dataset open does not exercise the missing-coordinate
placement path. The observation therefore does not establish that the
placement algorithm is the primary cause.

The next bounded activity is a stored-versus-derived diagnostic comparison and
sample-coordinate refresh decision. No runtime, schema, Coordinate, Core,
Extension, sample, or release operation was authorized by this audit. The
NarrativeLine Display-Order audit remains next in the pre-release sequence.

### E2R-LIAISONSCAPE-LICENSE-REMEDIATION1 (2026-08-30)

The LiaisonScape repository-owned MIT license blocker is now remediated. The
root `LICENSE` uses `Copyright (c) 2026 sukoyaka-dopeness`; `package.json`,
`package-lock.json`, and README are synchronized. The evidence is recorded in
[LiaisonScape License Remediation Result](../liaisonscape-license-remediation-result.md).

This closes only the license checkpoint. LiaisonScape remains `0.2.0` and
`private: true`; runtime, Dataset, sample, Core, Extension, and specification
licensing boundaries are unchanged. Initial Node Placement Objective Audit is
now next, followed by the NarrativeLine Display-Order Reordering Audit. The
Final Pre-Public-Release Audit has not been rerun, and public release remains
unauthorized.
