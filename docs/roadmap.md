# E2R Medium- and Long-term Roadmap

Date: 2026-08-17

Status: Current planning document; non-normative

## Purpose

This roadmap is the current priority summary for the E2R specification,
Validator, NarrativeLine, and LiaisonScape. Session logs remain historical records
and must not override this document merely because they contain older
future-work lists.

The architecture baseline comes from:

- `research/exploratory/extension-architecture-agenda-audit.md`;
- `research/extension-architecture/decisions/extension-identity-and-payload-key-decision.md`;
- `research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-maturity-and-identifier-decision.md`;
- `research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-space-component-compatibility-decision.md`;
- `research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-external-reference-decision.md`;
- `research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-version-and-space-evolution-decision.md`;
- `research/exploratory/linkscape-layout-and-view-state.md`;
- `research/exploratory/deterministic-generation.md`; and
- `research/exploratory/view-generation.md`.

## Operating principles

- Keep the Core minimal and stable.
- Make one responsibility change at a time.
- Preserve unknown Extensions whenever practical.
- Keep Extension identifier, display name, and specification version separate.
- Do not combine Coordinate and Layout into one universal Extension.
- Keep Perspective, Coordinate, Layout, Presentation, and Application View
  State distinct.
- Treat generated results as Derived until an intentional workflow adopts them
  under the responsible Core or Extension model.
- Require executable interoperability evidence before registering a candidate
  Extension as Stable.
- Keep ordinary Dataset use and Core validation independent of network access
  or an external registry.

## Current baseline

### Roadmap/status synchronization — 2026-08-17

- Research Physical Reorganization is completed. Its closure record is
  `sessions/E2R-Session-0028.md`.
- Names P1 and its Validator release workstream are completed. Names P1 may be
  consumed read-only by applications; no production writer, migration, repair,
  or Core `name` synchronization is authorized.
- Names Grouping remains deferred. Representation selection is not reopened.
- Coordinate remains at its frozen Prototype/Draft evidence boundary; the
  current specification-repository Validator evidence is the active support
  track.
- History vNext, Relative Time, Source/Citation, and Target Reference remain
  research or pending responsibilities; their older session “next task” lists
  do not supersede this roadmap.
- NarrativeLine remains at `0.1.0`. LiaisonScape `0.1.0` has completed its
  First Distribution.
- LiaisonScape now includes Entity and Relation creation and deletion,
  Entity/Relation detail editing, direct graph authoring, persistence,
  round-trip preservation, UI modularization, Home/entry UX, and bounded
  English/Japanese localization.
- Direct Graph Authoring MVP is complete. This includes direct Entity creation,
  Relation creation including self and parallel Relations, selected-Relation
  curvature manipulation, relation hit-area and discoverability improvements,
  and touch/pen gesture handling.
- Completion of these application workstreams does not change Core or Extension
  semantics and does not authorize Names writers, Relative Time semantics,
  Source/Citation product integration, or other deferred research work.

### Stable specification foundation

- Core defines Dataset, Entity, Event, and Relation.
- Relations connect Entity or Event endpoints; Relation-to-Relation endpoints
  are prohibited.
- Metadata and History are registered Stable Extensions.
- `metadata` and `history` remain immutable Extension identifiers and payload
  keys.
- History separates recorded chronology and `temporalOrder` from non-temporal
  authorial ordering.
- Extension identifiers are resolution-independent; exact Extension
  specification versions remain separate.

### Architecture work completed

- Agendas 1 through 9 have been consolidated and audited against the repository
  and current applications.
- Coordinate, Layout, provisional Perspective, Presentation, and Application
  View State responsibilities have been separated.
- Owned and Derived application data have been distinguished.
- Timeline, Graph, Tree, Table, Calendar, Map, and Spiral are now described as
  Application Visualizations rather than persisted Views.
- Determinism, reproducibility, and incremental stability have been separated
  around a versioned Engine research model.
- The Extension identifier remains the payload key. A second canonical
  identifier is not currently introduced.

### Agenda 1--9 reflection status

The repository-level reflection of the nine architecture agendas is
substantially complete. The accepted responsibility boundaries, terminology,
identifier model, exact-version model, deterministic-generation boundary, and
Coordinate evidence process are represented in current specification,
research, application, and Validator documents.

The remaining work is not mainly transcription from the agenda handoffs. It is
evidence-dependent follow-through:

- decide final Stable names and registration only after draft evidence gates
  pass;
- review and implement the separately identified Coordinate draft without
  changing the frozen prototype;
- implement and assess Layout, Semantic, Media, Presentation, and Perspective
  experiments independently; and
- repeat the formal cross-document audit before any Stable registrations.

For planning purposes, agenda-conclusion reflection is approximately 97%
complete. The larger implementation and candidate-formalization roadmap is
much less complete and must not be represented by that percentage.

### Application and tooling evidence

- Published Validator `0.3.0` includes the completed bounded Names P1
  validation release.
- Read-only Coordinate draft `0.1.0` Validator support is complete at the
  current evidence boundary. Applications do not write the Draft, and this
  support does not authorize migration or Stable registration.
- NarrativeLine `0.1.0` edits supported Metadata and History data, reads
  Coordinate prototype `0.1.0` in Entity/Event Detail, and provides a bounded
  second writer for existing Entity `x`/`y` values in LiaisonScape's exact shared
  Space while preserving unknown fields and Extensions.
- LiaisonScape `0.1.0` implements the Entity-first MVP, including graph
  interaction, deterministic fallback behavior, explicit Entity-coordinate
  save/restore, Relation editing, route and label interaction, and unknown-data
  preservation.
- `examples/cross-application-demo.json` exercises reusable Core, Metadata,
  History, parallel Relations, multiple self-Relations, Dataset Spaces,
  partial Event Coordinates, and multiple-Space Entity Coordinates across the
  applications.

LiaisonScape now migrates its legacy `coordinate` payload into the
authority-qualified Coordinate prototype `0.1.0`. The prototype remains an
application experiment, not an official Stable Coordinate Extension.

## Completed design milestone 1: Specification Extension redesign

Draft version `0.1.0` is now defined in
`extensions/specification-extension.md` as one coherent responsibility. It is
a design draft, not a registered Stable Extension.

### Accepted inputs

- The Extension identifier is also its Dataset payload key.
- `metadata` and `history` are not renamed.
- Core `version` remains separate from Extension specification versions.
- An exact used Extension version may be declared centrally at Dataset level.
- A payload without such a declaration means the Extension is present with its
  specification version unspecified.
- Unknown or unsupported declarations and payloads remain preservable.
- Specification interpretation and validation must work offline when the
  required implementation is locally available.
- The Specification Extension needs a finite one-level bootstrap for its own
  exact version.

### Design scope

The redesign should define conceptual records for:

1. Extension identifier and exact used specification version;
2. required dependencies and optional uses;
3. optional Features used by the Dataset;
4. compatibility statements distinct from dependencies;
5. immutable specification identity/version information;
6. mutable lifecycle and evolution metadata; and
7. the Specification Extension's own bootstrap.

### Deferred during the first pass

- a general online registry or discovery protocol;
- automatic schema downloads;
- publisher authentication;
- migration algorithms for every split or merge;
- a universal capability manifest for applications;
- changes to the Core schema; and
- registration of Coordinate, Layout, Perspective, Presentation, Semantic, or
  Media Extensions.

### Completion result

The draft now:

- declares exact versions for the Extensions actually used by a Dataset;
- distinguishes missing declaration, unsupported version, unavailable local
  specification, and invalid declared payload;
- expresses required and optional dependencies without invalidating unrelated
  Core data;
- supports partial Feature understanding without fragmenting every field into a
  Feature;
- resolves its own version with one finite bootstrap layer;
- retains older published specification versions as identifiable definitions;
  and
- includes representative valid, legacy, unsupported, and conflicting
  examples.

The remaining implementation evidence belongs to the Validator milestone
below. Stable naming, publisher authentication, and migration remain deferred.

## Completed implementation milestone 2: Validator interoperability model

Validator design now follows Specification Extension draft `0.1.0`.
Implementation must keep the draft replaceable and must not promote the
candidate to Stable by implication.

Planned diagnostics and fixtures should distinguish:

- Core validation failure;
- known Extension with version unspecified;
- exact declared version supported locally;
- declared version unsupported locally;
- specification unavailable locally;
- missing required dependency data;
- unsupported required dependency implementation;
- declaration referring to an absent payload;
- payload/declaration inconsistency; and
- unknown data that remains safely preservable.

Warnings and unsupported states must not be reported as Core structural errors.
Offline validation remains the baseline; network retrieval may only be an
optional future convenience.

The Validator now implements this model across Dataset, Entity, Event, and
Relation Extension containers. Specification fixtures cover exact support,
version unspecified, unsupported versions, unavailable specifications,
dependency absence, unsupported dependency implementations, declaration
conflicts, and invalid declared payloads. Exact declarations at unsupported
versions are not validated using a different version's rules.

## Application evidence track

This track may prepare fixtures and experiments while the Specification
Extension is designed, but it must not pre-empt its schema decisions.

### Completed evidence milestone 3: Coordinate prototype

Replace or explicitly migrate LiaisonScape's experimental
`{spaceId, x, y}`-style data through an unregistered prototype that tests:

- Dataset-level Coordinate Space definitions;
- stable Space and Component identifiers;
- component-keyed finite numeric values;
- partial coordinates;
- multiple Spaces;
- the same candidate structure for Entity and Event;
- relevant external coordinate standards; and
- a second application that interprets, rather than merely preserves, the
  coordinates.

Prototype `0.1.0` now implements all eight listed experiments in
`extensions/coordinate-extension.md` and
`examples/cross-application-demo.json`. LiaisonScape interprets and explicitly
saves Entity positions, including controlled migration from its legacy
payload. NarrativeLine independently resolves the same Dataset Spaces,
Components, units, partial values, and multiple-Space values in Entity/Event
Detail, with bounded editing only for compatible existing Entity `x`/`y`.
It also proves preservation through a supported Event edit and round trip. The
unreleased Validator now interprets exact
prototype `0.1.0`, reports `coordinate_*` conformance diagnostics separately
from Core diagnostics, and treats unsupported prototype versions as warnings.

The executable evidence milestone is complete. An external-reference fixture
is interpreted and round-tripped offline. Duplicate Space and per-object
Coordinate claims exercise the conflict baseline, and LiaisonScape refuses
incompatible definitions instead of overwriting them. NarrativeLine explicitly
updates only existing Entity `x`/`y` values in the same compatible
`liaisonscape-graph` Space. The tested sequential round trip through both
applications and the Coordinate-aware Validator preserves other Spaces and
unknown data.

The maturity review chose **revise**, not direct Stable promotion or indefinite
deferral. Experimental prototype `0.1.0` is frozen as the compatibility and
migration baseline. The separately identified normative candidate is now
assembled under `draft.github.sukoyaka-dopeness.coordinate` as draft `0.1.0`;
no Stable identifier has been selected or registered.

### Completed design milestone 4: Coordinate draft `0.1.0`

Accepted draft-design input now defines exact lexical matching for Space and
Component IDs and opaque semantic descriptors. Human-readable names never
authorize a write. A processor may write only through an explicit capability
profile matching the required `kind`, Component IDs, units, directions, and
period behavior. Coordinate itself does not infer aliases or perform unit
conversion. See
`research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-space-component-compatibility-decision.md`.

Accepted external-reference input keeps Dataset-local definitions as the
offline operational source of truth. The draft uses explicit
Component-level external bindings; unresolved or conflicting bindings prevent
external-aware writes but do not invalidate or replace locally valid data. See
`research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-external-reference-decision.md`.

Accepted bootstrap and evolution input makes the draft's required
Dataset-level `specVersion` authoritative and treats a supported Specification
declaration as a consistency assertion. Display names and bounds that preserve
all existing values may retain a Space ID; Component or semantic-definition
changes require a new Space ID and explicit migration. See
`research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-version-and-space-evolution-decision.md`.

The normative contract is assembled in
`extensions/coordinate-extension-draft.md`, with a complete-Dataset JSON
Schema, five valid fixtures, eighteen invalid fixtures, semantic fixture
validation, and atomic migration and refusal fixtures. Repository review found
and resolved ambiguity around context-only external writes, unsupported
Specification data, unknown Prototype fields, existing Draft collisions,
duplicate declarations, and opaque-ID diagnostic paths. See
`research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-draft-0.1.0-review.md`.

### Completed implementation milestone 5: read-only Validator support

Validator independently recognizes the Draft and Prototype identities,
bootstraps before schema selection, reports schema and semantic diagnostics,
distinguishes unsupported versions from malformed supported data, and
integrates Specification agreement. It remains read-only and does not migrate
application data.

The accepted decision and its alternatives are recorded in
`research/coordinate/decisions/coordinate-maturity-and-identifier-decision.md`.

### Layout persistence experiment

The responsibility and persistence boundary checkpoint is documented in
`docs/layout-persistence-responsibility-decision.md`. It records the current
non-normative design direction without selecting an identifier, schema, or
implementation.

The Automatic Layout experiment order and interoperability evidence ladder are
documented in `docs/automatic-layout-experiment-plan.md`. This remains an
experiment plan and does not establish a Layout identifier, schema, algorithm,
or maturity model.

Experiment 1 Label Stability is complete as bounded evidence. The
previous-placement approach showed partial improvement without changing
Dataset or Layout persistence. The next bounded experiment is graph density /
spacing, recorded in
`docs/automatic-layout-experiment-1-label-stability-result.md`.

Experiment 1B Density/Framing is now recorded as inconclusive evidence. Its
temporary spacing and initial-framing implementation was not adopted, and
current evidence does not support viewport framing as the primary cause of
label jumps. The next bounded experiment is Experiment 1C Angular Freedom.
Layout schema and identifier work remain not started.

The Experiment 1B follow-up found that expanding uniform Derived spacing from
`240 x 180` to the temporary `360 x 270` comparison did not materially
increase screen-space breathing room because automatic fit reduced the display
scale as graph bounds grew. Graph-space collision conditions may still change.
Node-based fit bounds, fixed 16-direction Node-label candidates, collision
penalties, and Relation-path effects remain separate unresolved factors. No
new spacing value or fit behavior was accepted, and Experiment 1B remains
`INCONCLUSIVE`.

Experiment 1C Angular Freedom is now recorded as bounded evidence with a
`CLEAR IMPROVEMENT / DIRECTION SUPPORTED` result. Increasing Node-label
candidate resolution from 16 to the temporary 32-direction comparison
exposed useful intermediate directions and improved some collision-triggered
placements. The comparison did not select 32 as a final constant or change
label distance, collision scoring, geometry, fit behavior, routing, or
persistence. The next bounded experiment is Experiment 1D Owning-Node
Proximity.

Experiment 1D Owning-Node Proximity is now recorded as
`MIXED / BOUNDED IMPROVEMENT`. The temporary axis-separated distance formula
showed some near-vertical improvement, but no clear diagonal or
long-description improvement. The exact formula was not adopted and the
baseline distance calculation was restored. Owning-Node proximity remains
unresolved; Angular Freedom remains the stronger supported direction. The next
bounded experiment is Experiment 1E Node-Label Recovery.

Experiment 1E Node-Label Recovery is now recorded as
`INCONCLUSIVE / DENSITY-LIMITED`. Recovery could return labels closer when
nearby preferred candidates became genuinely free after substantial Node
separation, but ordinary initial density often kept those candidates blocked.
The exact recovery gate was not adopted; previous-placement hysteresis and
the 32-direction baseline remain. Graph geometry density has stronger evidence
as an upstream factor. The next bounded experiment is Experiment 1F
Anisotropic Derived Spacing.

Experiment 1F Anisotropic Derived Spacing is recorded as
`INCONCLUSIVE / LIMITED APPLICABILITY`. The `360 x 180` fallback comparison
did not adequately exercise the main manual targets because stored Coordinates
and temporary direct-creation positions bypass the fallback grid. The
temporary spacing was not adopted and the `240 x 180` baseline was restored.
Future work should provide an intentional Coordinate-free automatic-layout
demonstration Dataset. Relation-label midpoint recovery and normal-distance
recovery remain separate future experiments.

Experiment 1G Node-Label Cardinal Preference is recorded as
`BOUNDED IMPROVEMENT / DIRECTION SUPPORTED`. A temporary `0.5` penalty per
11.25-degree step from the nearest cardinal axis made sparse placements more
orderly while retaining all 32 legal directions for dense-graph escape. The
weight is not final, cardinal-only placement is not accepted, and proximity
and density remain separate concerns. Future work now includes Node-label
drag-follow responsiveness during active Node movement and bounded
multi-line description wrapping; wrapping was not implemented. The next
temporary experiment is Experiment 1H Node-Label Drag-Follow Responsiveness.

Experiment 1H Node-Label Drag-Follow Responsiveness is recorded as
`CLEAR IMPROVEMENT / DIRECTION SUPPORTED`. Bypassing previous-placement
hysteresis only for the actively dragged Node's own label removed the observed
fast-drag trailing while preserving hysteresis for other labels. The exact
rule remains experimental. Future routing evidence should distinguish label
readability and ownership from edge overlap/crossing, and self-loop
orientation versus Node-label clearance remains a separate candidate.

Experiment 1I Bounded Description Wrapping is recorded as
`CLEAR IMPROVEMENT / DIRECTION SUPPORTED`. Preserving the 28-character visible
content limit while wrapping to a temporary maximum of two lines at width 20
reduced wide description footprints and improved dense readability and
automatic placement in English and Japanese. The geometry audit found an
8-unit Node-boundary-to-LabelRect-edge gap in both pure vertical and horizontal
placement; optical glyph inset remains separate. The temporary global +3
vertical shift was rejected. The next experiment is 1J Node-Facing Optical
Inset.

Experiment 1J Node-Facing Optical Inset is recorded as
`MIXED / DIRECTIONAL OPTICAL ASYMMETRY CONFIRMED`. A uniform 3px radial
text-only nudge produced little improvement above Nodes and over-corrected
below Nodes, so it was not adopted. LabelRect clearance remains unchanged;
future work should inspect visual geometry before another optical adjustment.
Qualitatively, 32 directions plus cardinal preference also appear to reduce
manual Node-label repositioning, though this is not yet a measured metric. The
next audit is Experiment 1K Directional Optical Geometry.

Experiment 1K Directional Optical Geometry is recorded as
`AUDIT COMPLETE / GEOMETRY CLARIFIED`. The audit confirmed an 8-unit
Node-boundary-to-LabelRect-edge clearance for pure horizontal and vertical
placements, a transparent hit rectangle, and TRUE GEOMETRIC TERMINATION at
the invisible LabelRect boundary. Directional optical asymmetry remains a
rendered-glyph question; adaptive connector visibility is recorded only as
future presentation research. No production geometry change was adopted.
The next temporary experiment is 1L Relation-label Drag-Follow
Responsiveness.

Experiment 1L Relation-label Drag-Follow Responsiveness is recorded as
`CLEAR IMPROVEMENT / DIRECTION SUPPORTED`. Bypassing previous-placement
hysteresis only for Relations incident to the actively dragged Node reduced
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal trailing while preserving stability for
unrelated Relations. Self-loops were included by the same endpoint condition.
Some labels still remain too far from their edge after movement; normal-
distance recovery and along-edge / midpoint recovery remain independent,
separate experiments. The next temporary experiment is 1M Relation-label
Normal-Distance Recovery.

Use a clearly authority-qualified, LiaisonScape-owned experimental payload to
test selected persistence of:

- ordinary and self-Relation routes;
- label placement;
- relative layer ordering;
- behavior after endpoint Coordinate changes;
- explicit adoption and return-to-automatic workflows; and
- partial support and preservation through NarrativeLine.

Automatic routes and label placement remain Derived. Only explicitly adopted
values become Owned experimental Layout data. Zoom, pan, selection, modal, and
scroll state remain outside the Dataset.

### Cross-application checkpoint

The current neutral sample now supports the tested workflow:

```text
NarrativeLine import/edit/export
    -> Validator
    -> LiaisonScape import/use/explicit save/export
    -> NarrativeLine re-import
```

The checkpoint verifies preservation of Core IDs, unknown fields, unsupported
Extensions, exact-version declarations, untouched experimental payloads, and
the shared Coordinate after sequential writes by NarrativeLine and LiaisonScape.
It is repeatable from the specification repository with
`npm run validate:coordinate-interoperability`; the ordinary `npm run validate`
remains independent of sibling application repositories.

## Research priority

### 1. Semantic responsibility and vocabulary architecture

Relation `name` is a human-readable Core label, not an interoperable semantic
type. Research should define how vocabulary identity, Relation typing, external
mapping, and application support interact without placing domain meaning in
Presentation.

### 2. Media responsibility

Use selectable LiaisonScape icons as the first concrete experiment. Media should
own reusable resources; Presentation may own their use as icons. Research must
cover identity, portability, supported formats, security, and preservation.

### 3. Presentation

Research reusable appearance only after the Media boundary is clearer. Label
placement and Relation routes remain Layout. Semantic meaning must not exist
only as color, icon, or line style.

### 4. Perspective

`Perspective` remains provisional. Begin with one real persisted grouping or
non-temporal ordering workflow rather than attempting the full Targeting,
Grouping, Ordering, Relevance, Ranking, and Coordinate Selection family at
once.

### 5. Deterministic Engine experiments

Prototype one purpose-specific, versioned Engine with explicit normalized
inputs, a validated delta, failure containment, Owned-value protection, and a
second adapter. Dataset ID is not a mandatory seed, and no universal Generation
Extension is planned.

### Cross-cutting research

Reference integrity and object lifecycle apply to Specification declarations,
Perspective, Coordinate, Layout, Presentation, Semantic, and Media data.
Deletion, replacement, split, merge, and dangling references require explicit
rules before affected Extensions become Stable.

Other continuing topics include:

- relative time, intervals, alternative calendars, and temporal constraints;
- multiple Datasets, lineage, merge, provenance, and cross-Dataset references;
- external identifiers, sources, and Wikidata import;
- Dictionary evolution and external vocabularies;
- AI-assisted analysis, validation, repair, and content generation; and
- visual comparison across Datasets.

## Application maintenance

- Keep Validator release automation, fixtures, package inspection, and
  tag/version checks healthy for the next published version.
- Keep NarrativeLine at `0.1.0` until an explicit release or version decision.
- LiaisonScape's First Distribution remains `0.1.0`; change its version only
  through an explicit follow-up version decision.
- Keep Japanese and English guides aligned when behavior changes.
- Preserve the LiaisonScape MVP boundary while architecture work continues.
- Treat major desktop/mobile UI divergence as later application design work,
  not a Core or Extension requirement.
- Add NarrativeLine time-of-day controls through progressive disclosure when
  that application task is prioritized; the History model already supports the
  relevant fields.

## E2R ecosystem hub / portal track

The E2R Studio idea recorded in `sessions/E2R-Session-0010.md` is retained as
an active application-planning direction: create a top-level hub or portal
that introduces E2R, presents the available applications, links to their
individual top pages, offers samples and documentation, and helps users move
between compatible application workflows. The hub is an application and
distribution surface, not a new Core object or a requirement that all E2R
applications share one UI.

The following ten milestones are ordered as a planning proposal. They balance
implementation difficulty, likely user need, and the amount of foundation they
provide for later E2R applications and distributable packs.

1. **Hub scope and information architecture** — define the audiences, first
   actions, application categories, links, sample flow, and the boundary
   between the portal and each application's own Home page.
2. **Static E2R landing page** — publish a small, fast top page explaining E2R,
   linking the four current repositories/apps, and providing a clear starting
   path for new users.
3. **Application catalog and status cards** — turn the application catalog into
   discoverable entries with purpose, maturity, supported capabilities, links,
   and explicit experimental/deferred labels.
4. **Shared sample gallery** — provide a small set of canonical datasets with
   previews and “open in application” links, while keeping samples versioned
   and self-contained.
5. **Onboarding and documentation paths** — add short guided paths for a first
   Dataset, timeline workflow, relationship workflow, validation, and
   cross-application preservation.
6. **Cross-application handoff links** — make the portal demonstrate import,
   export, validation, and preservation between NarrativeLine, LiaisonScape,
   and Validator without requiring a monolithic application.
7. **Capability and compatibility metadata** — define a lightweight,
   versioned description of application capabilities and supported Extension
   profiles so the hub can explain compatibility without guessing from names.
8. **Pack distribution foundation** — prototype discovery and manifest display
   for future Calendar, Locale, Dictionary, Orthography, and Style Packs;
   keep pack resources and Dataset declarations as separate responsibilities.
9. **User workspace and project entry model** — research a safe way to retain
   recent Datasets, selected applications, and project links without silently
   turning local application state into interoperable Dataset content.
10. **E2R ecosystem release surface** — establish a maintainable portal release
    process for applications, samples, documentation, compatibility metadata,
    and packs, including provenance, version selection, and offline/failure
    behavior.

The next practical step should be milestone 1 followed by milestone 2. A
static landing page can validate navigation and user demand at low cost before
the project commits to a registry, shared workspace, or pack ecosystem. None
of these milestones authorizes a Core change, a universal application UI, or
automatic interpretation of unknown application and pack metadata.

### Shared browser preference and workspace direction

The Hub should investigate a browser-local sharing layer for the E2R
ecosystem. A user who selects Japanese in NarrativeLine should be able to open
LiaisonScape with Japanese selected as well when the applications share an
origin. This is a user preference, not Dataset content: a future shared key
such as `e2r.preference.locale` may be stored in `localStorage`, with each
application reading it at startup. Optional live synchronization through
`BroadcastChannel` may be considered later, but next-startup sharing is the
initially sufficient behavior.

Dataset retention and application handoff belong to a separate browser
workspace layer. Small preferences may fit `localStorage`; retained Datasets,
recent projects, and application handoff records should be evaluated against
IndexedDB. A Hub could pass an opaque workspace key between applications
instead of placing a large Dataset in a URL. Neither layer should alter the
Dataset or become an implicit E2R Extension.

This direction depends on deployment topology. `localStorage`, IndexedDB, and
`BroadcastChannel` are origin-scoped, so two applications under the same
scheme, host, and port but different paths can share them, whereas different
localhost ports or future separate subdomains cannot. The Hub roadmap must
therefore research an explicit bridge or server-backed workspace before
assuming cross-origin sharing. This is a future architecture question, not a
current application or Core implementation requirement.

## Canonical sample follow-up

The canonical cross-application sample baseline now includes the Apollo 11
Mission English/Japanese wrapper-free Datasets under `examples/`. They are
intended for Timeline, relationship-graph, Validator, and future Hub workflows;
application Home samples remain application-specific and are not changed by
this addition.

The Apollo consumer evidence is recorded in
`research/exploratory/cross-application-canonical-sample-consumer-evidence.md`.
It documents the accepted Coordinate-only adoption boundary, the current
Layout persistence gap, and future Hub, rendering, multilingual, and temporal
research prompts. It is non-normative evidence and does not authorize a Core,
Extension, or application implementation change.

## Sample and external vocabulary follow-up

Two application/ecosystem tasks are explicitly recorded for future planning:

- Revise the NarrativeLine public sample Dataset so that opening the same
  Dataset in LiaisonScape produces an interesting, legible relationship graph.
  The sample should remain useful as a Timeline in NarrativeLine while adding
  meaningful Entity-to-Entity structure, selected Event connections, and
  compatible Coordinate data. This is sample and application work, not a reason
  to weaken NarrativeLine's Timeline identity or change the Core.
- Research on-demand vocabulary retrieval from thesauri, Wikidata, and other
  external sources for use with Dictionary and future Semantic capabilities.
  Retrieved data must be treated as external/derived input until deliberately
  adopted, with source identity, retrieval time, version or revision, license,
  language, and failure/offline behavior preserved. Network retrieval must not
  be required to open or validate an otherwise valid Dataset, and a lookup must
  not silently create identities, meanings, Relations, or Semantic assertions.

This external-vocabulary idea is related to the existing roadmap topics of
external identifiers, Wikidata import, Dictionary evolution, and AI-assisted
analysis, but is a distinct research task concerning on-demand retrieval,
provenance, caching, deterministic selection, and adoption boundaries.

## Application UX maintenance follow-up

The following bounded application-maintenance items are recorded for both
NarrativeLine and LiaisonScape. They do not change E2R Core or Extension
semantics:

- review the visual scale of operation buttons on desktop and narrow mobile
  layouts; the current controls feel oversized relative to both the desktop
  composition and the phone viewport. The review must preserve touch-target,
  keyboard, and contrast requirements while reducing visual disproportion;
- align NarrativeLine's browser Back/Forward behavior with LiaisonScape's
  Home/workspace model, including Dataset retention and direct-entry or
  refresh behavior;
- align the Home navigation control in NarrativeLine view headers with
  LiaisonScape's current header treatment, while keeping navigation semantics
  explicit and preserving the active Dataset;
- audit modal and confirmation-dialog focus behavior in both applications.

The proposed modal keyboard policy is deliberately action-sensitive. Ordinary
forms and non-destructive confirmations may initially focus their primary
decision so Enter can complete the common action. Destructive confirmations,
especially deletion, should initially focus Cancel or another non-destructive
choice. Enter activates only the currently focused control; it must not be a
global shortcut that bypasses the visible focus. Escape, focus containment,
return focus to the opener, and an always-visible focus indicator remain
required. This keeps keyboard use efficient without making an accidental
Enter press delete data.

These items are future application work, not authorization for a broad visual
rewrite. Each application should receive focused interaction tests for
browser history, Dataset continuity, responsive button sizing, modal focus,
Enter/Escape behavior, and destructive-action safety before release.

## Proposed E2R-wide milestones

The following ten milestones provide a cross-repository sequence using three
selection criteria: low implementation risk, clear user need, and value as a
foundation for future E2R applications and Extensions.

1. **E2R ecosystem information architecture** — define the relationship among
   the specification, Validator, NarrativeLine, LiaisonScape, future apps, and
   the E2R hub.
2. **First-use hub and application directory** — publish a lightweight entry
   page with application purposes, maturity, supported capabilities, samples,
   and documentation links.
3. **Canonical cross-application samples** — maintain Dataset fixtures that
   are useful in both Timeline and Graph applications, including the revised
   NarrativeLine sample and explicit preservation expectations.
4. **Interoperability verification baseline** — make import, export, Validator
   checks, unknown-data preservation, and cross-application round trips a
   repeatable release gate.
5. **Validator compatibility matrix** — publish which Core and Extension
   versions, Features, dependencies, and application profiles each tool
   supports.
6. **History and chronology completion** — resolve dated/undated ordering,
   Relative Time, intervals, and advanced History responsibilities before
   product integration.
7. **Application capability and pack manifest research** — define how apps,
   Calendar, Locale, Dictionary, Orthography, and Style Packs declare identity,
   version, dependency, compatibility, provenance, and licensing.
8. **Dictionary and Semantic foundation** — establish vocabulary identity,
   semantic assertions, external mappings, and preservation boundaries without
   putting domain meaning into the Core.
9. **On-demand external vocabulary experiment** — prototype read-only lookup
   from a thesaurus or Wikidata with explicit provenance, cache/version policy,
   offline fallback, rate/error handling, and intentional adoption into a
   Dataset or Extension.
10. **Evidence-gated ecosystem releases** — coordinate application releases,
    Validator releases, Extension evidence, sample revisions, and pack
    publication without requiring network access or silently changing stored
    Dataset meaning.

The recommended immediate sequence is milestones 1 through 4, with the sample
revision as a bounded parallel task. External vocabulary retrieval should begin
only after the Dictionary/Semantic responsibility boundary is written down;
otherwise a convenient lookup can accidentally become an unreviewed identity
or meaning system.

## Evidence gates for candidate Extensions

| Candidate | Current evidence | Missing before formalization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specification | Draft `0.1.0`, architecture audit, accepted identifier model, bootstrap, dependencies, Features, Validator implementation and fixtures | Multi-application evidence, Stable identifier decision |
| Coordinate | Frozen prototype `0.1.0`; reviewed draft candidate `0.1.0` with normative contract, schema, 5 valid/18 invalid fixtures, semantic validation, explicit atomic migration/refusal fixtures, and read-only Validator support | Application Draft writer/migration evidence, draft cross-application evidence, later Stable identifier review |
| Layout | LiaisonScape routes, loops, labels, and layer requirements | Explicit experimental persistence, endpoint-change rules, round trips, partial support, second renderer |
| Perspective | Nine-agenda conceptual model | Final naming review, concrete workflows for at least two capabilities, reference lifecycle, partial support |
| Presentation | LiaisonScape appearance requirements | Media boundary, reusable vocabulary, semantic independence, unknown-property preservation, second renderer |
| Semantic | Relation labels demonstrate unmet semantic typing need | Vocabulary identity, typing model, external mapping, two consuming applications |
| Media | Future selectable icon requirement | Resource identity, format/security rules, two application uses, Presentation dependency test |

Each candidate passes independently. Evidence for Layout does not register
Coordinate or Presentation, and a useful visualization does not justify a
universal View Extension.

## Explicitly deferred

Unless new evidence changes the decision, do not currently:

- expand the Core for presentation or application behavior;
- rename `metadata` or `history`;
- combine Coordinate and Presentation into Layout;
- serialize ordinary Application View State into the E2R Dataset;
- standardize LiaisonScape's current experimental Coordinate payload;
- create a universal Generation Extension;
- register Perspective before its name and workflows are proven;
- treat arbitrary Relation direction as semantic hierarchy; or
- make external registry or network access mandatory.

## Immediate sequence

1. Preserve the LiaisonScape `0.1.0` First Distribution and Direct Graph
   Authoring checkpoints as the current application baseline.
2. Select exactly one bounded follow-up workstream through its own scope and
   evidence gate before implementation.
3. Keep Names P1 product integration, Names Grouping, Relative Time,
   History vNext, Target Reference, Source/Citation, Provenance/Confidence,
   Semantic/Dictionary, and Layout/Presentation responsibilities independently
   gated.
4. Continue Coordinate Draft work only through its existing evidence gates;
   read-only Validator support does not by itself authorize application Draft
   writers, migration, or Stable registration.

The ordering above does not select the next product feature. A later handoff or
explicit planning decision may choose one bounded follow-up without reopening
unrelated workstreams.

At every step, prefer the smallest change that increases executable evidence
and keeps Core and Extension responsibilities distinct.
